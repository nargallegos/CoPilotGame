This project is a test of GitHub Copilot, an AI programming assistant. I am using it to assist me in developing a game using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## About the Game

The game is currently under development. Copilot decided we are going to use Snake as the foundation of our ever evolving game. However, I am renaming the game to Worm. 

## TODO:
- [x] Fix head collision
- [x] Time based food spawning
- [x] Each food spawn should be unique object
- [ ] Spawn golden apples
- [ ] Fix bug where game freezes when apple is spawned
- [ ] 

## Setup and Installation

To run this game, you will need Python and Pygame installed on your machine. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
# Install Python
https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Install Pygame
pip install pygame
```

After installing the necessary packages, clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory, and run the main game file.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
python main.py
```

## Testing with GitHub Copilot

Throughout this project, I am using GitHub Copilot to assist with coding. It provides suggestions for completing lines or blocks of code, generating new code, and even writing tests. It's a great tool for speeding up development and learning new coding patterns.
